,Step No,Issue Identified,Columns Affected,Action Taken
,1,Raw dataset extraction and structuring required,All columns,"Extracted ~40,000 records from ORIGINAL_DATASET using Python and created structured RAW_DATASET for preprocessing"
,2,Need for clean analytical dataset,All columns,Imported cleaned base data into CLEANED_DATASET using ARRAYFORMULA to maintain dynamic updates
,3,Inconsistent date formats,"Date of Occurrence, Date Reported, Date Case Closed",Standardized all date fields into uniform date format for accurate temporal analysis
,4,Inconsistent time format,Time of Occurrence,Standardized time values to proper time format for time-of-day grouping
,5,Blank or invalid records present,All columns,Removed unwanted blank and invalid rows from dataset
,6,Missing categorical values,"Weapon Used, Victim Gender, Date Case Closed",Cleaned empty values and recoded missing case closure as “Not Closed”
,7,Inconsistent categorical labels,"City, Crime Domain, Crime Description",Standardized naming conventions to ensure consistent grouping in pivots
,8,Risk of formula errors due to null values,Derived columns,Verified formulas and ensured no breakage from missing values
,9,Combined temporal fields,Date–time fields,Split combined date-time columns into separate date and time attributes
,10,Need for analytical time variables,Date of Occurrence,Created derived columns: Month of Crime and Year of Crime
,11,Need for scalable derived fields,Analytical columns,Ensured all engineered variables are formula-driven for dynamic updates
